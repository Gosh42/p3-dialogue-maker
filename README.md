# P3 Dialogue Maker (WIP)
This is a tool that allows you to generate fake Persona 3 (PS2) screenshots. It aims to be fairly accurate to the original game, generating images in the same resolution and aspect ratio as the original game on the PS2.  
Inspired by https://deathgenerator.com/

Made using Godot. No releases yet as it's still WIP, planned to have a standalone PC release as well as a web version accessible in browser.
